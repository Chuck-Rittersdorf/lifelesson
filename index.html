                { title: "Beliefs Drive Actions, True Self-Care is Deep Work", text: "Everything you do, right or wrong, is born out of a set of beliefs.

True self-care involves introspection to identify and address these patterns and limiting beliefs." },
                { title: "Slow Down in an Age of Speed", text: "In an age of speed, aim to slow down. Living slow makes you more mindful and intentional. You begin to take care of your body, mind, and soul, so they can care for you. Consciously choose to slow down, be present, and prioritize well-being. This fosters mindfulness and deeper self-care." },
                { title: "The Power of Journaling", text: "Journaling is a timeless and priceless form of therapy.

In an age of constant distraction, focus is a valuable asset. Daily meditation can train your mind and enhance concentration." },
                { title: "Equation for Financial Wealth", text: "The equation for financial wealth: Learn to manage your money, master a valuable skillset, and create more than you consume.

                { title: "Believe in Yourself First", text: "You have to believe in yourself before anyone else does. That’s the cornerstone of real confidence.

                { title: "The Best Things in Life are Imperfect & Free", text: "Nature, laughter, kindness, love, and self-compassion—the best things in life are imperfect and free.
